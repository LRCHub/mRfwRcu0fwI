Windows down
Pedal to the sneakers
Turn up the volume
Blow up the speakers
Best clothes on
Goin' down on fire
Turn the lights off
Turn the music higher
I broke free, cast away
Won't find me
And now your never gonna break me down, gonna break me down
This is all I can take, so farewell
'Cause your never gonna find me now,
Gonna find me now
We are young! (woah) we are young! (woah)
We drink and we fight and we love just because
Just because we are dumb, (woah)
We're on the run (woah)
And your never gonna chase us down.
We are young.
Dance with the devil
Don't be shy
Nothing's gonna stop us
We can't die
Sleepin' in a bed
Waking up outside
At least I can say I tried
So you fathers don't let go of your daughters
We take what we want we don't borrow
Think I found a message in a bottle
This is tricky down your sorrows
I broke free, cast away
Won't find me
And now your never gonna break me down, gonna break me down
This is all I can take, so farewell
'Cause your never gonna find me now, gonna find me now
We are young! (woah) we are young! (woah)
We drink and we fight and we love just because,
We are dumb, (woah) We're on the run (woah)
And your never gonna chase us down.
We are young, young, young (woah)
We are young, young, young (woah)
We are young, young, young (woah)
And your never gonna chase us down
We are young
If I'm doin' this right
I'll be leavin' tonight
I got my bags packed tight
So many reasons to leave
I got my hands on my keys
Ya I'll be leavin' tonight
We are young! (woah) we are young! (woah)
We drink and we fight and we love just because,
We are dumb, (woah) we're on the run (woah)
And your never gonna chase us down.
We are young, young, young (woah)
We are young, young, young (woah)
We are young, young, young (woah)
And your never gonna chase us down
We are young
