Hold your breath, it's not gonna last long
You'd better cut your hair
Leave it until tomorrow we're losing sight
But we've seen enough
You'd better come with us
This place has nothing to offer

We are young, we're just gonna mess it up
Let us play, let us play like David said
We are young, we're just gonna mess it up
Let us play, let us play like David said

Take your time, don't speak so loud
With their eyes drilled upon us, we are waiting for the end
So don't decide, show your fight
You'd better come with us
This place has nothing to offer

We are young, we're just gonna mess it up
Let us play, let us play like David said
We are young, we're just gonna mess it up
Let us play, let us play like David said

We are young, we're just gonna mess it up
Let us play, let us play like David said
We are young, we're just gonna mess it up
Let us play, let us play like David said

We are young, we're just gonna mess it up
Let us play, let us play like David said
We are young, we're just gonna mess it up
Let us play, let us play like David said

We are young, we're just gonna mess it up
Let us play, let us play like David said
We are young, we're just gonna mess it up
Let us play, let us play like David said
